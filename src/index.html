                <h2>the door was always open</h2>
                <p>
                    a line drawn in the air. it separates <i>this</i> from
                    <i>that</i>. that’s all it is: separation...
                </p>
                <p>
                    separation is not disappearance but it (the line) bends back
                    on itself -creates gaps of space- an opening... how does one
                    traverse between openings? through the gaps perhaps? but, no
                    this isn't about getting from one place to another in the
                    way you might think of travel in the classical meaning of
                    that word. imagining instead of thinking the probability.
                    the open door represents an invitation… or perhaps a
                    consequence. it might suggest something _wanted_ this space
                    to exist and in order for that to happen, that something
                    facilitated it. it might not necessarily be welcoming. after
                    all, even a gift can have malevolent intents behind it, and
                    an opening can lead to a trap. the fact that it's _already_
                    open is the crucial part. you didn't create it. you found
                    it. how does it feel finding something that has already been
                    prepared for you i wonder… that might imply someone else was
                    involved in its creation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    consider this: if a door were closed, you would have agency.
                    you could choose to knock, to try and enter. but an open
                    door removes that choice, a choice that presents itself as
                    inevitable. it’s a path laid out _before_ you even
                    considered walking it. the unsettling part isn't the
                    destination on the other side -we don't know what that is-
                    the unsettling part is the lack of explanation for the
                    opening itself. why now? why this way? who left it like
                    this?! what do they want from your arrival? does that…
                    resonate at all? it's simple to understand that it's a shift
                    in potential, and an alteration to expectation.
